Evaluation Project for Odyssea 
Build a Personal page using HTML and CSS

Note on background color change:--->

The Javascript code is not my code. 
I found online an example of background color change by clicking a button using Javascript. 
However the addition of color change for the navigation's menu and social media icons I added myself.

This feature was essential to the website's concept. <----
