# FE2109EvalPersonalPage
Evaluation Project for Odyssea 
Build a Personal page using HTML and CSS

Note on background color change:
The Javascript code is not my code. 
I found an example of background color change with a button using Javascript online. 
However the addition of the navigation's menu color change I added myself.

This feature was essential to the website's concept.
